**ULTImodel** &mdash; A universal transport distribution model written in Python.

## Description
**ULTImodel** is a distribution model that helps to spatially distribute road-based transport for countries, including border-crossing travel. It is set up using open data like [OSM](https://openstreetmap.org).
The software includes modules for network generation, trip generation and trip distribution based on two main inputs:

* Georeferenced traffic analysis zones (TAZ) for the respective region
* Target value for national transport volume (i.e. person-kilometres or tonne-kilometres)
